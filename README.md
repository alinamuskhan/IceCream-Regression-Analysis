## Ice Cream Simple Linear Regression Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a regression analysis of ice cream sales, focusing on the relationship between temperature and sales volume. The project utilizes a simple linear regression model to predict ice cream sales based on temperature data, providing insights into consumer behavior.

## Objectives

- Analyze the correlation between temperature and ice cream sales.
- Build a predictive model to estimate sales based on temperature.
- Visualize findings to enhance understanding of sales patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset includes features such as:
- **Temperature (°C)**: Daily temperature readings.
- **Ice Cream Sales**: Number of ice creams sold on corresponding days.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset and preparing it for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to uncover patterns and relationships.
3. **Model Development**: Implementing a simple linear regression model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as R² and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
5. **Visualization**: Presenting the regression line and residuals for clarity.

## Tools and Libraries

This analysis is conducted using Python with the following libraries:
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Results

The analysis demonstrates a positive correlation between temperature and ice cream sales, with the regression model providing reliable predictions. Visualizations effectively illustrate the relationship and the model's fit.

## Conclusion

The Ice Cream Regression Analysis reveals that higher temperatures lead to increased ice cream sales. This insight can inform marketing strategies and inventory management for ice cream retailers, particularly during warmer months.
